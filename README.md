# CryptoPrices
A simple kotlin app that show up to date details about the top 100 crypto currencies (It updates the details every 10 minutes) 

I am currently learning Kotlin and this is first project I that I have ever made with it.
I was trying to make a very small project with a very simple functionality so I didn't put any effort in designing the UI.
